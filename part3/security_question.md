To secure the tech startup's system, which includes a different elements and roles, we should consider the following aspects for each component of the infrastructure:

Mobile App:

1. Data Transmission: Implement secure communication through TLS/SSL to protect data in transit between the mobile app and backend services. Sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card data, should be strongly encrypted.

2. Authentication and Authorization: Enforce strong authentication methods and secure session management to prevent unauthorized access. Also, implement role-based access control to ensure that only authorized actions are allowed.

3. Secure Offline Storage: Protect locally stored data on the mobile device, including session tokens, with encryption.

4. Secure Code: Perform regular code reviews to identify and mitigate mobile-specific vulnerabilities such as insecure data storage and sensitive data exposure

Web Frontend:

1. Input Validation: Clean up user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Use security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS.

2. Security Headers: Implement HTTP security headers to enhance the security of the web application. Examples include Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) and X-Content-Type-Options.

3. Authentication and Session Management: Ensure that user sessions are securely managed and protected from session fixation and hijacking attacks. Ensure that all session information in cookies, cache and local storage is encrypted.

4. API Security: Validate and sanitize data sent to and received from the Python backend to prevent security misconfigurations and injection attacks.

MySQL Database:

1. Secure Database Access: Limit access to the MySQL database to only the necessary components and employees. We can use AWS IAM roles and ensure strong password policies.

2. Data Encryption: Encrypt data at rest using encryption mechanisms provided by a cloud provider, for example AWS RDS encryption.

3. Database Auditing: Enable database auditing and logging to monitor and detect suspicious activities. Include abnormal activity alarms in the database.

Python Backend:

1. API Security: Implement input validation, and ensure all data sent to the database is properly sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks.

2. Authentication and Authorization: Enforce strong authentication and authorization controls. Implement role-based access control by adding middleware and API rate limiting. For authorization endpoints, return tokens encrypted with a strongly secret key.

3. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information and provide informative but non-exploitable error messages.

4. Secure Libraries: Regularly update libraries and dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

Employees:

1. Access Control: Follow the principle of least privilege. Grant employees only the permissions necessary for their roles and responsibilities.

2. User Training: Provide security training to all employees, making them aware of security best practices, the importance of data protection, alerting them to social engineering attacks and how to report security incidents. Develop protocols and step-by-step guides to mitigate damage in the event of an attack.

3. Monitoring and Audit Trails: Monitor employee actions, especially those with access to customer data. Maintain audit trails for accountability and incident response.

4. Offboarding: Ensure that access is revoked promptly when an employee leaves the organization.

By addressing these security issues specific to each infrastructure component and ensuring proper security controls, we can significantly improve the overall security of our application. Also, regular security audits and assessments should also be part of the security strategy to keep abreast of evolving threats.

To finish, next is a summary based on the OWASP Top 10 for 2021:

OWASP Top 10 - 2021 summary:

1.  Broken access control:
    Implement robust access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality. Restrict access to the database and other critical resources. For example, the MySQL database would have 3 different roles for the employees that only allow certain functions. Regularly review and enforce permissions and privileges based on user and employee roles.

2.  Cryptographic Failures:
    Ensure that sensitive data, such as customer passwords and personal information, is properly encrypted both in transit and at rest. Verify that the app follows secure cryptographic practices and uses strong encryption algorithms. Encryption keys should be generated randomly and stored in memory.

3.  Injection
    Ensure that input from mobile apps, web frontend, and any external sources is properly sanitized, validated and authorized before interacting with the MySQL database or other components. Implement parameterized queries and properly constructed stored procedures to prevent SQL injection.

4.  Insecure design:
    Evaluate the design of the app to ensure it follows secure design principles. This includes secure session management, separation of user roles and permissions, and implementing a strong authentication mechanism.

5.  Security misconfiguration:
    Audit the Kubernetes containers and AWS configurations to identify and rectify any security misconfigurations. Follow the principle of least privilege and review permissions to minimize the attack surface.

6.  Vulnerable and Outdated Components:
    Regularly update and patch components, libraries, and dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities. Ensure that cloud providers have robust security protocols and minimal vulnerabilities. Utilize vulnerability scanning tools to identify and address potential issues within the infrastructure.

7.  Identification and Authentication Failures:
    Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for all users, including software engineers employees, customer support employees, and the sales employee. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible. Protect passwords with strong hashing, nd salting. Regularly review and audit authentication processes. Use VPN and corporate email for secure communication channels.

8.  Software and Data Integrity Failures:
    Validate and clean data entry to prevent tampering. Properly manage errors to prevent data leakage and consider applying checksums or digital signatures to verify data integrity.

9.  Security Logging and Monitoring Failures:
    Establish robust logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents. Ensure that logs capture relevant security events, and that you have processes in place to review and act on these logs quickly.

10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):
    Review the application to prevent SSRF attacks. Restrict the ability of an attacker to make requests to unintended internal resources, and validate user inputs to prevent such attacks.
